# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project uses a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy. It demonstrates the power of neural networks in image recognition tasks.

Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using a neural network to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

Dataset
- The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.

Model Architecture
- Uses a Neural Network (NN) with multiple layers.
- Includes Dense (Fully Connected) Layers with activation functions like ReLU and Softmax.
- Optimized using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Performance
- Achieves high accuracy on the test dataset.
- Can be further improved using CNNs or data augmentation.
